# React + TypeScript + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Create a React app where users can:

Add todo items
Mark items as completed
Delete todo items
(Optional) Filter by all/completed/active

useTodoState() ---- uses redux tool kit
That provides:
Access to todos and current filter
Pre-wrapped action dispatchers (addTodo, toggleTodo, etc.


🧠 Redux store with localStorage
✅ Typed action + reducer setup
🔄 Two custom hooks: useTodoState and useFilteredTodos
🎨 Fully styled UI with Tailwind: input, todo list, filter tabs
🏁 Complete wiring from main.tsx to components
